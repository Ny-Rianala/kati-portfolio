I'm Kati, a front-end developer at Onja based in Madagascar, willing to work with developers whenever in the world. I like spending my time reading books or articles. Also, I love contributing to and doing volunteering work.

I develop websites with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'm also familiar with React, Redux and TypeScript. I also have a skill in using design software like Figma.

I am excited to dive deep in learning other programming languages that suit my role as a front-end developer.
